        <h5>IoTeX Delegate Program Overview</h5>
        <h6 style={{ color: "#00d1b2" }}>What is the role of a Voter?</h6>
        <p>
          IoTeX is a digital democracy where token holders vote for{" "}
          <strong>Delegates</strong> to maintain and grow the network.
        </p>
        <p>
          The top 36 voted delegates are <strong>Consensus Delegates</strong>{" "}
          that manage consensus on behalf of the entire IoTeX network and so are
          responsible for:
          <ul>
            <li>Maintaining servers and network</li>
            <li>Creating and validating blocks</li>
            <li>Processing smart contracts and transactions</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <h6 style={{ color: "#00d1b2" }}>How to become a Voter?</h6>
        <div className='columns is-centered'>
          <img
            src='https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*0HrnSl0R7r70Ihw5ae2cgg.png'
            className='is-centered'
          />
        </div>
        <p>
          Any token holder who stakes IOTX and votes for an IoTeX delegate is a
          "Voter". A delegate is someone who stakes over 1.2 million IOTX and
          receives over 2 million total votes.
        </p>
        <h5>Voter Requirements</h5>
        <p>
          Voters have 3 requirements:
          <ol>
            <li>
              <strong>Delegates website</strong>
            </li>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Voters will use the IoTeX delegates website to view all delegate
                candidates and vote
              </li>
              <li>
                There is a smart contract integrated into the website which
                voters must use to access the MetaMask web tool
              </li>
            </ul>
            <li>
              <strong>MetaMask webtool</strong>
            </li>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Install MetaMask - it is the bridge between your wallet and the
                IoTeX voting smart contract
              </li>
            </ul>
            <li>
              <strong>IOTX tokens</strong>
            </li>
            <ul>
              <li>
                To stake/vote, you will need IoTeX ERC-20 tokens (IOTX) which
                you can purchase on exchanges
              </li>
            </ul>
          </ol>
        </p>

        <h6 style={{ color: "#00d1b2" }}>Staking</h6>
        <p>
          There are two concepts that voters need to be aware of:
          <ol>
            <li>Staking IOTX to generate voting power</li>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Token holders stake IOTX tokens to get votes. 1 IOTX = 1 Vote
              </li>
              <li>
                Setting a stake duration generates bonus votes based on the
                formula Bonues votes = log<sub>1.2</sub>*(Stake duration)
              </li>
            </ul>
            <li>Auto-staking to maintain bonus votes</li>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Bonus votes will reduce over time if not auto-staked. They
                diminish every day and trend towards 0 at the end of the stake
                duration. To maintain bonus votes (i.e. no dimishing bonuses),
                you can auto-stake for a specific duration.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </ol>
        </p>
        <div className='columns is-centered'>
          <img
            src='https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*EooVt2Rb06XHWORK'
            className='is-centered'
          />
        </div>

        <h6 style={{ color: "#00d1b2" }}>Voting</h6>
        <p>
          To vote for a delegate, you must use a voting smart contract. One
          wallet can create multiple "buckets" which means you can vote for
          multiple delegates. One bucket per delegate.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can redirect your votes to a new delegate and extend your stake
          duration at any time.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you don't set a stake duration, you can unstake at any time, but
          you won't receive any bonus voting power.
        </p>

        <h6 style={{ color: "#00d1b2" }}>Ranking</h6>
        <p>
          Delegates are rank-ordered in real time based on their total votes
        </p>
        <p>
          A Delegateâ€™s total votes includes votes for oneself (self-stake) and
          votes from other token holders.
        </p>
        <p>
          The top 36 voted Delegates are the Consensus Delegates for the current
          epoch, and of these 36, 24 are randomly
        </p>

        <h6 style={{ color: "#00d1b2" }}>Rewards for Delegates</h6>
        <p>Delegates are rewarded in IOTX tokens every epoch</p>
        <p>
          Rewards are distributed from the rewards pool, consisting of:
          <ul>
            <li>Reserved mining tokens (1.2 million IOTX)</li>
            <li>
              Transaction fees (all gas fees from IoTeX network transactions)
            </li>
            <li>
              Other contributions (donations from IoTeX foundation or other
              parties)
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        <h6 style={{ color: "#00d1b2" }}>Rewards for Voters</h6>
        <p>
          Rewards for voters will vary based upon which delegate the voter has
          voted for.
        </p>
        <div className='columns is-centered'>
          <img src='https://i.imgur.com/efifhdj.png' />
        </div>
        <p>
          Generally, delegates will split their delegate rewards into roughly 3
          sections:
          <ul>
            <li>Hardware/infrastructure costs</li>
            <li>Community/development funds</li>
            <li>Rewards for voters</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          For iotxplorer in particular, we have pledged to give 87% of all our
          reward bonuses to our voters. The majority of the remaining funds will
          be spent on dApp development and adding value to the network, and some
          will be used to cover hardware costs.
